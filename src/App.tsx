  const LINUX = `
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to
as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to
calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto
itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning
GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and
vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every
day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the
version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux",
and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU
system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and
these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system
they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that
allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you
run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but
useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a
complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination
with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU
with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux"
distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
